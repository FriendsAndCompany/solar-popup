# Solar-popup

A lovely little vanilla TypeScript popup.

## Why

I made this popup was for my own consumption, but you are free to use it too!

## Features

* It will close on ESC press key, clicking on the close x button anchor or submit events from children
* Adds a modal background that fades in with CSS3 transitions
* Popup itself slides in with CSS3 transitions

## Demo

  [Basic usage](https://quantumjs.github.io/solar-popup/demo/)

## Roadmap

Configuration options for the popup sliding in and the modal backgrounds color settings
